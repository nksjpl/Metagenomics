# Metagenomic Analysis Pipeline for Illumina and Nanopore Sequences
    1. Data Preprocessing

    Objective: Ensure high-quality input data by removing artifacts, adapters, and low-quality reads.

    Illumina-specific:

    #Tools: 
        FastQC (quality assessment).
        Trimmomatic or Cutadapt (adapter trimming, quality filtering).
    #Steps:
        1. Run FastQC to visualize raw read quality (e.g., per-base quality scores, adapter content).
        2. Trim adapters and low-quality bases (e.g., Q<20), remove reads shorter than 50 bp.
        3. Re-run FastQC post-trimming for QC validation.
    
    #Command Example for bash

    Nanopore-specific:

    #Tools: 

	NanoFilt (filtering and trimming).
	Porechop (adapter removal).

	#Steps:

    1. Filter reads by quality (e.g., Q>10) and length (e.g., >500 bp) using NanoFilt.
    2. Remove adapters with Porechop.
    3. Assess quality with NanoStat.

    #Command Example for bash

    porechop -i input.fastq -o trimmed.fastq 
    nanofilt -q 10 -l 500 trimmed.fastq > filtered.fastq
